ONLINE VOTING SYSYTEM
Voter can cast vote remotely from anywhere in the country with the help of an android device and voting application on his device. I have used Aadhar Number and Voter ID for unique identification of users, and they can register using these details in the application. I have also implemented admin operations on the app like in this case we assume government is the admin, so the admin has operations like adding new voters, adding new parties and also admin can see live results of the elections as soon as the voting starts![Screenshot_1638683301](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89287917/146402858-b3355679-3925-41c8-a95e-4e220165752c.png)
